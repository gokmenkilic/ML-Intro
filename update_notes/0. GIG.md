- Updated the dataset links 

- The warning regarding input_shape in layers.Reshape can be fixed by removing the argument. In the Keras Functional API, shape inference is handled automatically by the graph, so explicit input shapes are only needed at the keras.Input layer.

Proposed Change (The decoder):

- x = layers.Reshape((4, 4, 64), input_shape=(1024,))(x)
+ x = layers.Reshape((4, 4, 64))(x)


- Fix invalid escape sequence SyntaxWarning in histogram plot

SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\c' when running the plotting code on Python 3.12+.

This happens because the LaTeX commands (\cal, \mu, \sigma) are inside a standard Python string, which tries to interpret them as escape sequences.

Escape the backslashes for the LaTeX commands so Python treats them as literal characters.

- ax.set_xlabel('Galaxy shape: %s , Feature %s\n~${\cal N}(\mu=%.1f, \sigma=%.1f)$' %
+ ax.set_xlabel('Galaxy shape: %s , Feature %s\n~${\\cal N}(\\mu=%.1f, \\sigma=%.1f)$' %
