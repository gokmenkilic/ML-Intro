# Remove the normalize parameter 

- Removed normalize=True from LinearRegression()
- Applied the scaler.transform() to actually normalize your train/test splits
- Renamed variables to avoid confusion between the full dataset and train/test splits


pro fix:

from sklearn import set_config

# This tells sklearn to return Pandas DataFrames instead of Numpy Arrays
set_config(transform_output="pandas")

1. The normalize error: This parameter was intentionally removed by the scikit-learn developers in version 1.2. They did this to force users to use StandardScaler (which is chemically/scientifically more accurate for your gas temperature data anyway). If you report it, they will simply close it as "By Design."

2. The reset_index error: This is standard Python behavior. Scikit-learn transformers return NumPy arrays (which are just fast lists of numbers without labels), not Pandas DataFrames. Arrays don't have indexes, so they don't have a .reset_index() method.

# Changes in Input Layer:

- Input(len(features)) → Input(shape=(len(features),)) - Input expects a shape tuple
lr=0.001 → learning_rate=0.001 - The lr parameter was deprecated in newer Keras versions
- Fixed indentation on the return model statement (it was outside the function)
- Fixed indentation on the for loop
